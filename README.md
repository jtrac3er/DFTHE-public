# DFTHE
Collection of different approaches for achieving fully homomorphic encryption, using complex numbers over a finite field combined with discrete fourier transform

## What is FHE
Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a special type of encryption, where operations on encrypted ciphertexts is possible, without decryption and reencryption. In FHE, the set of such operations on ciphertexts allows for all computable functions to be evaluated. The applications of an exact and efficient FHE encryption scheme would be revolutionary, as nowadays, only very inefficient and not very accurate (based on real numbers) solutions exist. 

## Approaches in this repo
I came up with some ideas for such an efficient and accurate scheme which support homomorphic multiplication and addition. Further investigations by myself showed, that the schemes were insecure. But still, maybe the building blocks with which I came up can be used to construct a secure scheme.
